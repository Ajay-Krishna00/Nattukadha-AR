# Naattukadha AR

An **Augmented Reality (AR) mobile app** built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [@reactvision/react-viro](https://github.com/viromedia/viro), designed to bring **Kerala’s cultural heritage** to life.

With this app, users can experience **3D AR models** of Kerala’s iconic art forms and legends, such as **Kathakali**, **Theyyam**, and **Jatayu Rock**, directly through their smartphone camera.

Inspired by Pokémon Go but focused on cultural preservation, this project aims to make Kerala’s history, art, and legends more **interactive, immersive, and educational**.
